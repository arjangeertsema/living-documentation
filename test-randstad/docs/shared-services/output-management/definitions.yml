- name: preheader
  text: |
    The term preheader describes the first text lines of an email, which are displayed in some mail clients before the subject and the actual content of the email. 
    The preheader is primarily used on smartphones and mobile devices to give the recipient of the email a first glance at the email content and to offer them an alternative online version if the email does not display correctly on the mobile device. 
    Against the backdrop of a Mobile First strategy, preheaders are also used to spark the interest of the recipient and increase opening rates with a call for action. 
    Along with the email sender and subject line, the preheader is the first element mobile device users can see and interact with.
